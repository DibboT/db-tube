                </h1>
                <p class="mt-10 mb-10 text-lg pl-8">variables declared with the var can not have block scope and they can be
                    declared inside a {} block.
                    It can be accessed outside of the block.

                    var statemnet declares function-scoped or globally-scoped variables.

                    <br>In ES6, <b>let</b> was introduced. let can be re assignable. It declares block-scoped local variables.

                    let is much more updated than var. If a variable declares with let in a block it is available for
                    use within that block.
                    <br><b>const</b> was also introduced in ES6 along with let. the variable declared with const can not be updated or re-declared.

                    variable declared with const have bloc scope. const is block-sccoped.

                </h1>
                <p class="mt-10 mb-10 text-lg pl-8">In Javascript,
                    <b>Null</b> means an empty value. It is also a primitive type in Javascript.
                    When we assign null as a value to any variable which indicates empty or blank.
                    That variable has no value.
                    <br><b>undefined</b> is one of the primitive types of Javascript.
                    If a value was not returned , a function returns undefined.
                    When we do not pass an argument for a function parameter, the default value is taken as undefined.

                    What do you mean by REST API?
                </h1>
                <p class="mt-10 mb-10 text-lg pl-8">REST api is an interface where information can exchange securly between
                    computers.
                    REST API was created by Roy Fiedling.
                    The Full For of REST is Representational State Transfer which use for creating web services.
                   <br> REST API communicates via HTTP requests and perform standard database including creating, reading,
                    updating and deleting records.
                    REST API uses less bandwidth which makes it more suitable.
